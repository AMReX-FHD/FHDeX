** FHD-KMC coupling **

1. git repo
 - git clone https://github.com/AMReX-FHD/FHDeX.git
 - most recent development is in the branch "compressible_stag_mui"

2. compile FHD
 - go to the directory "FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui"
 - "make -j8" will give you the executable "main3d.gnu.MPI.ex"
 - if you use a slurm scheduler (e.g. on cori or pinnacles), set "USE_SLURM = TRUE" in "GNUmakefile"

3. complie SPPARKS
 - go to the directory "FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui/SPPARKS_MUI"
 - "make -j8 mui" will give you the executable "spk_mui"
 - if you use a slurm scheduler (e.g. on cori or pinnacles), use "make -j8 mui_slurm", whcih will give you "spk_mui_slurm"

4. example execution (on a local machine i.e. without slurm)

 - go to the directory "FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui/test_COAr_eq"
 - execute "./run.sh" 

 - to check FHD:     "tail -f log.fhd" 
 - to check SPPARKS: "tail -f log.spparks" 

 - to change the numbers of MPI processes, edit "run.sh": "mpirun -np 1 ... : -np 1 ..." 
 - to change the number of time steps, edit 
   = "inputs_fhd_stag": "max_step = 10"
   = "in.kmc": "variable nstep equal 10"

 - if you use a slurm scheduler (e.g. on cori or pinnacles), go to the directory "FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui/test_COAr_eq_slurm"
