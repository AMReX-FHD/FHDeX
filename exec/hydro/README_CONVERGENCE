To perform convergence testing in 2D and 3D, simply run the .sh script file to generate plot files of your solution:

./run_convergence_tests.sh

This script edits values within the "inputs_dtrmnistic_convergence_${dim}d" input files, and runs three test cases (coarse/medium/fine) back-to-back: In each subsequent case the number of spatial gridpoints dividing the domain increases, and timestep decreases, by a factor of 2.  The plotfiles are stored in the ./Data_Convergence_CR/ subdirectory.

The user simply needs to specify these dimensions in "run_convergence_tests.sh". This script, when ran, will also update the correct values in "compute_convergence_rate.sh", which is the script that uses AMReX plotfile convergence tools which computes the desired norm difference between the values contained withing each plotfile.

./compute_convergence_rate.sh

To run this script, you must first build DiffSameDomainRefinedStag (in 2D and/or 3D) in amrex/Tools/C_util/Convergence.  Edit the GNUmakefile to select the dimension, and set "EBASE = DiffSameDomainRefinedStag".

Running this script will print the difference in the L1 norms to the terminal: one between the coarse/medium solutions, and another between the medium/fine solutions.

and semicoarse grid solns, and another between the semicoarse and fine solns. Taking the log2 of the ratio between these two numbers will result in the convergence rate.
