This directory contains the inputs files which can be used to study propagation of ice front in a supercooled liquid.

General instructions:
1. Remember to change the values of thermophysical properties according to the table given within.
2. You can turn stochasticity on/off by setting variance_coef_* to 1/0.

In ./
inputs_slab_3d:         inputs to measure the propagation speed of ice/water interface at various temperatures in a pillar geometry.
inputs_nucleus_3d:      inputs for simulationg growth of an ice nucleus at various temperatures in a cubic domain.

In ./_Validation/
inputs_laplace:         to measure laplace pressure inside an ice nucleus in a deterministic setting.
inputs_spectrum:        to measure the spectral energy in a long slab and compare with theory.
