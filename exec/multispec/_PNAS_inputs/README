This directory contains the inputs files used for the results in "Fluctuating Hydrodynamics and
the Rayleigh-Plateau Instability

_thickness directory:  inputs to measure interface thickness at different chi

_laplace directory:    inputs to measure interfacial tension from Laplace pressure

inputs_spectrum:       inputs to measure capillary wave spectrum

inputs_RayleighPlateau:  inputs for default Rayleigh Plateau simulations
                         run with different seeds to create an ensemble
                         for smaller runs reduce length and numoer of mesh points in z direction
                             keeping mesh size the same

inputs_high_schmidt:     inputs for default configure but with higher viscosity and Schmidt number
