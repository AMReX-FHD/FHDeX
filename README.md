# FHDeX

Code libraries and numerical implementations of incompressible and low Mach number
multispecies mixtures with thermal fluctuations.

The algorithms use a fluctuating hydrodynamics approach, where each dissipative flux
is supplemented with a stochastic contribution.

The code uses a staggered grid velocity field and cell-centered scalars.

Also includes modules for:

-a general multispecies diffusion model based on the Maxwell-Stefan formulation
-implicit viscosity via a projection-preconditioned Stokes solver
-stochastic chemistry
-electrodiffusion
